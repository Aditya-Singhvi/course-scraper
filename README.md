# course-scraper
Scrape course information from InfiniteCampus to aid students in choosing their classes. Creates a .csv file with the relevant course information.

### motivation
Often, schools do not release explicit period-by-period class schedules, nor do they allow for specific period/teacher/semester requests. This code scrapes information from InfiniteCampus, a frequently-used schedule management tool, to create an easy-to-use interface for finding the specific classes.
